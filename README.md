## [WIP] Blackjack Card Counting Simulation Tool

This is a tool I made to calculate the profitability of various card counting strategies for blackjack. It includes common strategies like HiLo, but the focus is the more generalized LinearStrategy abstract class, which takes a set of features that the player could observe by keeping track of the cards that have been dealt so far and optimizes a decision boundary for any given situation in blackjack (e.g. you have a 16 vs. the dealer's 10).
