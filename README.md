## [WIP] Blackjack Card Counting Simulation Tool

This is a tool I made to calculate the profitability of various card counting strategies for blackjack. It includes common strategies like HiLo, but the focus is the more general LinearStrategy abstract class, which takes a set of features that the player could observe by keeping track of the cards that have been dealt in previous hands and optimizes a decision boundary for any given situation in blackjack (e.g. you have a 16 vs. the dealer's 10). The goal is to identify a system that can be implemented by a human that also captures a large percentage of the expected value gained by knowing what cards have been removed from the shoe (the shoe is the six or eight decks from which hands are dealt). This will likely remain a work in progress for some time because I'm 18, so I can't play blackjack for another three years anyway.
